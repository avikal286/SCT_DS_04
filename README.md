Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions,weather and time of day visualise accident hotspot and contribution factors
# 🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis 🚧

Welcome to the **Traffic Accident Data Analysis** project!  
This project dives into real-world traffic accident data to uncover patterns in accidents related to **weather**, **road conditions**, **time of day**, and **location**.

> "Data tells the truth — and the truth is on the roads."

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Identify when and where traffic accidents happen most often
- Analyze how **weather**, **road surface**, and **time** influence accidents
- Visualize **accident hotspots** and **severity distribution**
- Support **road safety improvements** with data-driven insights

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 🧮 **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- 📊 **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values, datetime conversion, etc.

---

## 🧪 Key Insights

- 🚑 **Severity Trends:** Distribution of minor vs. major accidents
- 🌦️ **Weather Impact:** Rain, fog, and other weather conditions increase risk
- 🕒 **Time of Day:** Accidents spike during evening rush hours
- 📍 **Hotspots:** Most accidents occur in certain city zones

## 📊 Sample Visuals

> *A picture is worth a thousand data points...*

- Bar charts of accident severity
- Line plots of accident frequency over time
- Location-wise accident count (heatmap-ready)
